# Supply-Chain-Optimization-Using-Python:

This Repository has use cases and solutions that leverages Mathematical (Linear/Non Linear) Optimization to drive Supply Chain Decisions.
A low capacity and high capacity plant across 5 countries are considered and a linear programming model is built.

# Case-Study_of_Plant Capacity_&_Supply Chain Optimization

Assume the case study data is from a car manufacture optimizing its Supply Chain network across five regions (i.e. USA, Germany, Japan, Brazil, and India). You are given the demand, manufacturing capacity (thousands of cars) for each region, and the variable and fixed costs (thousands of $US dollars). Four Pandas DataFrames demand, var_cost, fix_cost, and cap have been created for you, and printed in the console, containing the regional demand, variable production costs, fixed production costs, and production capacity. The var_cost shows the costs of producing in location i shipping to location j. Which statement is true based on the data.
